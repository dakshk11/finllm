 Expedia Group reported strong operational performance in the latest fiscal year, with revenue growth of 12% driven by cost efficiency and favorable market conditions. Gross profit margin expanded to 67.5%, while operating expenses grew at a slower pace, resulting in an operating income of $714 million and an operating margin of 7%. The net income attributable to the Obligor Group was $566 million, translating into a net profit margin of 5.6%. However, increasing competition and operational challenges may impact future profitability. The balance sheet revealed total assets of $17.8 billion, with a weak liquidity position due to negative net working capital and current ratio below the industry average. The long-term debt to equity ratio was balanced at 1.0x. Cash flow analysis showed an increase in net cash provided by operating activities, effective working capital management, and a focus on cost control. Despite significant cash outflows for investments and financing, the company maintained a strong liquidity position. Overall, Expedia Group's financial health is average, with potential challenges in managing short-term obligations and maintaining liquidity. Recommendations include expanding presence in high-growth markets, enhancing technology offerings, implementing cost savings measures, and addressing liquidity concerns through strategic financing initiatives to optimize capital structure and enhance shareholder value.
