 The balance sheet of Expedia Group as of December 31, 2023, reveals total assets of $17.8 billion, with current assets accounting for $7.4 billion or 41% of the total. Current liabilities amounted to $11.9 billion, resulting in a net working capital position of negative $4.5 billion. Long-term assets were $10.4 billion, and long-term liabilities stood at $6.8 billion, leading to a net long-term position of $3.6 billion. Shareholders' equity was reported as $7.2 billion.

Regarding liquidity, the company's current ratio of 0.6x is below the industry average, indicating potential short-term financial stress. However, the quick ratio of 0.4x suggests that the firm may face difficulties meeting its immediate obligations. In terms of solvency, the long-term debt to equity ratio of 1.0x indicates a balanced capital structure.

Comparing these ratios with previous years' data reveals an improvement in the net working capital position due to increased current assets and a decrease in current liabilities. However, the liquidity position remains weak. The company's financial leverage is moderate, with a debt to equity ratio of 1.0x. Asset management appears effective, as total assets exceed total liabilities. Overall, Expedia Group's financial health is average, with potential challenges in managing its short-term obligations and maintaining liquidity. Future prospects depend on the company's ability to improve its liquidity position and effectively manage its capital structure.
