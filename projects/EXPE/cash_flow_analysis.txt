 In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, Expedia Group reported net cash provided by operating activities of $5.6 billion, an increase from $4.9 billion in the previous year. The improvement was driven primarily by strong revenue growth and effective working capital management. Capital expenditures totaled $1.7 billion, a decrease from $2.0 billion in 2022, indicating a focus on cost control. Financing activities included $3.5 billion of net borrowings, partially offset by $1.4 billion of issuances under the company's ATM program and $1.6 billion of repayments under long-term debt. The company also made dividend payments totaling $200 million during the year. Despite the significant cash outflows for investments and financing, Expedia Group maintained a strong liquidity position with $4.8 billion remaining under its share repurchase program and no significant maturities due on long-term debt within the next 12 months. Overall, the company's effective cash management, combined with its robust operating performance and solid balance sheet, positions it well for future growth opportunities while also addressing potential financial challenges stemming from external market risks.
