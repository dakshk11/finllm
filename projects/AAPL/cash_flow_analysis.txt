 Apple reported strong operating cash flow of $81.4 billion for the fiscal year 2023, driven by robust sales growth across its product segments. Investing activities saw a significant increase due to capital expenditures on property, plant, and equipment, as well as an increase in research and development expenses. Financing activities showed net borrowings of $15.4 billion primarily due to issuance of debt securities to fund share repurchase programs and dividends paid out. Compared to the previous year, operating cash flow increased by 23%, while investing and financing activities saw a significant increase due to higher capital expenditures and debt issuances. The company's liquidity position remains strong with $148.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of September 30, 2023. However, the increasing trend in capital expenditures and debt issuances could pose potential financial challenges if not sustained by continued revenue growth. Overall, Apple's effective cash management and strong liquidity position enable it to continue investing in its business and returning value to shareholders while maintaining a solid financial footing.
